 I focused on looking at the data without preemptove football knowledge despite being very involved in football.

 So i picked the data set that have only the location of all the players and the location of the ball

I tried to look at how far the players from the ball

The whole idea was to look at the positional data, calculate player speed, and also measure their x and y positional velocity changes
