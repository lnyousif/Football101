# FOOTBALL ANALYSIS

Group 3 set out to analyze a dataset from one football (soccer) match to understand if any key themes or insights could be found. The team began the analysis with some summary statistics, but then delved deeper into various visualizations or correlations that could "bring the match to life". Some key analyses conducted include:
- **Spatial analysis:** Identify how different players on each team positioned themselves during the game
- **Event analysis:** Determine the success rate of certain "events" and their impact throughout the match
- **Temporal analysis:** Understand how the ball position varied throughout the game
- **Visual analysis:** Build a view that used the raw data to showcase a re-enactment of the match

The team approached this analysis in the following manner:
1) What data do we have?
2) What can we do with this data?
3) What additional analyses could be performed if more data was available?

The following sections break down how the team approached each of these questions:
1. **What data do we have?**
    - We had three files to work with (along with corresponding datapoints tracked):
        - *Raw Events data*
            - 1,746 rows x 14 columns
            - Column Names
                - Team
                - Type
                - Subtype
                - Period
                - Start Frame
                - Start Time [s]
                - End Frame
                - End Time [s]
                - From
                - To
                - Start X
                - Start Y
                - End X
                - End Y
            
        - *Raw Tracking data for the Home Team*
        - *Raw Tracking data for the Away Team*












The Metrica Sports sample data you mentioned provides a rich resource for soccer analytics, offering detailed tracking and event data from soccer matches. The data's structure, with coordinates ranging from 0 to 1 on each axis and standardized field dimensions (105x68 meters), facilitates various analyses. The synchronization of tracking and event data allows for in-depth analysis of player movements, team formations, and specific game events such as passes, shots, and fouls.

Given the details provided:

1. **Spatial Analysis**: The data enables spatial analysis of player positions and movements. For instance, understanding how players use the field space during different phases of the game can provide insights into team strategies.

2. **Event Analysis**: With the detailed event types and subtypes, one can analyze the frequency, success rates, and patterns of various events like passes, shots, and defensive actions. This can help in assessing team and player performance.

3. **Temporal Analysis**: By considering the time information for each event, it's possible to study the dynamics of the game, like changes in team strategies or intensity throughout the match.

4. **Player Performance Metrics**: The data can be used to create performance metrics for players, such as distance covered, pass accuracy, shot effectiveness, and defensive contributions.

5. **Team Analysis**: Team-level strategies and formations can be analyzed by aggregating individual player data. This could involve studying offensive and defensive shapes or transitions between them.

6. **Predictive Analytics**: Using machine learning algorithms, one can predict future outcomes like goal probabilities based on current game situations, player positions, and historical data patterns.

7. **Visualization**: The data can be visualized to create heat maps, trajectory plots, and other visual tools to represent player movements, event locations, and game patterns.

For further analysis, it would be important to consider the specific research questions or objectives you have in mind, as this will guide the type of analysis to be conducted. Additionally, access to the software tools or programming skills (e.g., in Python or R) is necessary to process and analyze the data effectively.
